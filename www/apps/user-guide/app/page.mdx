## Tour of Medusa Admin

After you log into your Medusa Admin, you see a sidebar menu to the left with a search bar at its top, a <InlineIcon Icon={BellAlert} alt="bell" /> at the top right, and in the middle the content of the page you’re currently on.

### Sidebar Menu

The sidebar menu includes the main navigation of your Medusa Admin. You can use it to navigate between different pages, such as Products or Orders pages.

![Sidebar Menu](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1739529281/User%20Guide/Screenshot_2025-02-14_at_12.34.22_PM_oeyaol.png)

You can hide the sidebar by clicking the <InlineIcon Icon={SidebarLeft} alt="sidebar" /> icon at the top next to the sidebar. Clicking it again shows the sidebar.

### Sidebar Shortcuts

Sidebar items have shortcuts. For example, the Products page has a <Kbd>G</Kbd> then <Kbd>P</Kbd> shortcut. To view the shortcut of an item, hover your mouse for a few seconds and a tooltip will appear with the shortcut.

You can also find all shortcuts by clicking on your profile item at the bottom of the sidebar and choosing "Shortcuts".

### Settings and Quick Actions

At the bottom of the sidebar you'll find a Settings item, which takes you to further settings of your store such as Region and Sales Channel management. You'll also find your avatar and name.

By clicking on your avatar and name, you'll view quick actions such as going to profile settings, view shortcuts, or changing the admin theme.

### Search Bar

At the top of the sidebar, you'll find a search item. You can also open the search window using the shortcuts:

- Windows and Linux: <Kbd>CTRL</Kbd> + <Kbd>K</Kbd>
- Mac OS: <Kbd>⌘</Kbd> + <Kbd>K</Kbd>

You can select a result with your mouse, or use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to navigate between the results, then choose a result by hitting the <Kbd>Enter</Kbd> key.

### Check Notifications

At the top right you’ll find a <InlineIcon Icon={BellAlert} alt="Bell" /> icon. Clicking this icon opens a side window to view any notifications you might have. Use this to view notifications such as completed product exports.
