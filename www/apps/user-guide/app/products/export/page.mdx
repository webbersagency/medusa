4. In the side window that opens, you can see any filters you've applied.
5. Click on the Export button to start the export.
6. To check the export's status, click the <InlineIcon Icon={BellAlert} alt="bell" /> icon at the top right of the page. You should see your new export loading.
7. Once the export is ready, click the <InlineIcon Icon={ArrowDownTray} alt="download" /> icon.
