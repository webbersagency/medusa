Medusa Admin comes with multi-language support. Multi-language support is only for the Medusa Admin interface, not for the content, such as product description.

This document covers the complete list of available languages, both official and by the community. To learn how to change the language, refer to [this documentation](../../settings/profile/page.mdx).

<Note>

Can't find your language? Learn how you can contribute by translating the admin to other languages [here](!resources!/contribution-guidelines/admin-translations).
