In this guide, you'll learn how to view and manage campaigns.

## What is a Campaign?

A campaign is a collection of promotions related to specific marketing or sales goals. A campaign also gives you granular control over promotion usages, allowing you to set up start and end dates, and budget usages that once exceeded, the promotions of the campaign can't be used anymore.

    - You can set a campaign budget of the following types:
        - **Usage**: How many times the promotions in the campaign can be used. Once the number of times exceed the limit, the campaign and its promotions expire.
        - **Spend**: The total amount that can be discounted by the promotions in the campaign. Once the total amount discounted exceeds the limit, the campaign and its promotions expire. This is not applicable to "Buy X Get Y" promotions.
    - If you chose the **Spend** type, select the currency of the limit in the "Currency" field.
        - When adding promotions to the campaign later, promotions that discount a fixed amount can only be added if the currency matches the campaign budget's currency.
    - In the Limit field, you can set a campaign budget limit based on the type you chose.
        - If you chose **Usage**, enter the number of times the promotions in the campaign can be used.
        - If you chose **Spend**, enter the total amount that can be discounted by the promotions in the campaign.
4. Once you're done, click the Create button.
