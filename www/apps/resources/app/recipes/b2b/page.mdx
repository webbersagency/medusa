This recipe provides the general steps to implement a B2B store with Medusa.

<Note title="Tip">

Medusa has a ready-to-use B2B starter that you install and use in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/medusajs/b2b-starter-medusa).

</Note>

## Overview

In a B2B store, you provide different types of customers with relevant pricing, products, shopping experience, and more.

Medusa’s commerce modules, including Sales Channel, Customer, and Pricing modules facilitate implementing this setup. Medusa’s architecture and extendible nature allow you to customize your store based on your use case.

## Create B2B Sales Channel

Use sales channels to set product availability per channel. In this case, create a B2B sales channel that includes only B2B products.

You can create a sales channel through the Medusa Admin or Admin REST APIs.

## Create a Publishable API Key

Use publishable API keys to specify the context of client requests:

- You associate the publishable API key with one or more sales channels.
- In a client such as a storefront, you pass the publishable API key in the header of your requests.

Then, all products retrieved belong to the associated sales channel(s).

You can create a publishable API key through the Medusa Admin or the Admin REST APIs, then associate it with the B2B sales channel. Later, you'll use this key when developing your B2B storefront.

## Add Products to B2B Sales Channel

You can create new products or add existing ones to the B2B sales channel using the Medusa Admin or Admin REST APIs.

## Create B2B Module with Relationship to Customer Groups

Use customer groups to organize your customers into different groups. Then, you can apply different prices for each group.

This is useful in B2B sales, as you often negotiate special prices with each customer or company.

You can create a B2B module that adds necessary data models to represent a B2B company. Then, you link that company to a customer group, which is defined in the Customer Module. Any customer belonging to that group also belongs to the company, meaning they're a B2B customer.

    text: "Learn how to create data models.",
    icon: AcademicCapSolid,

<Card
  href="!docs!/learn/fundamentals/module-links"
  title="Create Module Links"
  text="Learn how to create links between modules."
  icon={AcademicCapSolid}
  className="mt-1"
/>

## Add B2B Customers

After adding your B2B customer group, add B2B customers and assign them to the B2B customer group.

You can do that through the Medusa Admin or Admin REST APIs.

### Create Customers

  text="Create the customers using the REST APIs."

### Assign Customers to Groups

  title="Assign Customers to Groups"
  text="Assign the customers to the B2B customer group using the REST APIs."
  icon={AcademicCapSolid}

---

## Create B2B Price List

Use price lists to set different prices for each B2B customer group, among other conditions.

You can create a price list using the Medusa Admin or the Admin REST APIs. Make sure to set the B2B customer group as a condition.

<Card
  href="!api!/admin#price-lists_postpricelists"
  title="Create Price List"
  text="Create the price list using the REST APIs."
  icon={AcademicCapSolid}
/>

---

## Create Custom Data Model

To implement a more advanced B2B sales flow, add custom data models such as `Company`, `Employee`, `Admin`, and `Buyer` to your B2B module.

This provides more granular control of your B2B sales and allows you to build features like privileges, limits, and more.

  href="!docs!/learn/fundamentals/modules#1-create-data-model"
  title="Create a Data Model"
  text="Learn how to create a custom data model in a module."
  icon={AcademicCapSolid}
/>

---

## Create an API Route to Check Customers

On the frontend clients communicating with your store, such as the storefront, you need to check whether the currently logged-in customer is a B2B customer.

The API route can check if the customer has any group with an associated company.

## Customize Admin

Based on your use case, you may need to customize the Medusa Admin to add new widgets or pages.

The Medusa Admin plugin can be extended to add widgets, new pages, and setting pages.

<CardList items={[
  {
    href: "!docs!/learn/fundamentals/admin/widgets",
    title: "Create Admin Widget",
    text: "Add widgets into existing admin pages.",
    icon: AcademicCapSolid,
  },
  {
    href: "!docs!/learn/fundamentals/admin/ui-routes",
    title: "Create Admin UI Routes",
    text: "Add new pages to your Medusa Admin.",
    icon: AcademicCapSolid,
  },
]} />

<Card
  href="!docs!/learn/fundamentals/admin/ui-routes#create-settings-page"
  title="Create Admin Setting Page"
  text="Add new page to the Medusa Admin settings."
  icon={AcademicCapSolid}
  className="mt-1"
/>

## Customize Storefront

Medusa provides a Next.js storefront to use with your application. You can either customize it or build your own to represent your B2B features.

Use the publishable API key you associated with your B2B sales channel in the storefront to ensure only B2B products are retrieved.
